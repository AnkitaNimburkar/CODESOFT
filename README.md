# CODESOFT

Welcome to my internship repository for Java development at CODSOFT! In Repository CODSOFT_TASK 1 2 & 4, you'll find a collection of projects completed during my internship journey. These projects highlight my growth and dedication to mastering Java programming concepts.

For the first task, I crafted a Number Guessing Game, challenging users to guess a number randomly generated within a specified range. Moving on to the second task, I developed a Student Grade Calculator, adept at computing total marks, average percentages, and assigning grades accordingly. The third task saw the creation of a Quiz Application complete with a timer, enhancing user engagement through an interactive quiz experience.

Each task is neatly organized into its own folder, accompanied by a detailed README file providing instructions on how to run the respective program. To bolster credibility and validate my efforts, a video demonstration showcasing my work will be shared on LinkedIn.
